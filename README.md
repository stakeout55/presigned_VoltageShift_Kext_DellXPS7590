# Presigned VoltageShift.Kext for DellXPS7590
This is a pre-signed version of the UnderVolt.kext to under volt your machine. Only tested on my XPS 7590.

## USE AT OWN RISK - THIS CAN PERMENANTLY DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER

I wasn't ever able to get the original Voltage Shift to work [Here](https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift) so I did some work and came up with a modified / pre-signed version. I take no credit for invention/creation of this kext!!!!

Cd to working directory of voltageshift in terminal and run the following:
`sudo chmod +x voltageshift`

Then you will be good to go!

This guide is helpful, I think Iâ€™m around -110 -92 -110

But am still testing. Enjoy!

I'm sure that this works with other Hacks/Macs but I have yet to test.
