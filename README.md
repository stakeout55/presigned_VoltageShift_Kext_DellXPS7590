This is a pre-signed version of the UnderVolt.kext to under volt your machine. Only tested on my XPS 7590. See [latest releases](https://github.com/stakeout55/presigned_VoltageShift_Kext_DellXPS7590/releases/latest)

`## USE AT OWN RISK - THIS CAN PERMENANTLY DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER`

I wasn't ever able to get the original Voltage Shift to work [Here](https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift) so I did some work and came up with a modified / pre-signed version. I take no credit for invention/creation of this kext!!!!

## Getting started -- CLI Interface for VoltageShift:
Cd to working directory of voltageshift in terminal and run the following:
`sudo chmod -R 0755 VoltageShift.kext  
sudo chown -R 0:0 VoltageShift.kext  
./voltageshift info`

This will start up VoltageShift in CLI format. Follow the guide below for settings and usage...

I think Iâ€™m around `-110 -92 -110`

But am still testing. Enjoy!

I'm sure that this works with other Hacks/Macs but I have yet to test.
